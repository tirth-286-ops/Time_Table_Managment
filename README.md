Timetable Management System is a web-based platform developed to simplify the complex task of creating and managing class timetables for college departments. Scheduling lectures, lab sessions, and break times can be challenging due to factors like faculty availability, overlapping sessions, and fixed lab durations. This platform is designed to solve these issues by offering an intuitive and conflict-free scheduling experience.
Administrators can assign subjects, labs, and break times to specific slots with ease, while the system automatically checks for scheduling clashes. If a faculty member is already assigned to another class during the same time slot, a warning is displayed to prevent double bookings. Break periods are also clearly defined to ensure no session is mistakenly scheduled during those times.
The system supports custom time slots, multi-slot lab sessions, and flexible break configurations. The generated timetable is neatly organized and easy to read, making it accessible to both faculty and students. To enhance usability, the timetable can be exported in PDF and Excel formats for printing or sharing.
By streamlining the scheduling process and preventing conflicts, the Timetable Management System reduces manual workload, saves time, and ensures a smooth academic schedule for all stakeholders involved.

# User Details #
Admin:
The admin is the sole user of the Application of Timetable and has full control over all its features. This role is responsible for managing every aspect of the timetable, including:
1.	Adding and managing faculty, courses, subjects, and time slots
2.	Scheduling lectures, labs, and breaks
3.	Ensuring no conflicts occur (e.g., a faculty member assigned to multiple sessions at the same time or overlapping sessions across tracks)
4.	Allocating track-wise sessions for AI-ML, Web, and Common tracks
5.	Displaying lab sessions as continuous blocks, if needed
6.	Downloading the timetable in PDF or Excel format
Only the Admin can log in to the system. There are no other user roles such as mentors, students, or public visitors. This ensures that timetable management remains centralized, secure, and easy to maintain by the designated administrator.
